Lazy smart shortcodes for displaying often included key-information and other WordPress content. Over 80 shortcodes to use anywhere on your website.
== Description ==
The *oik base* plugin provides a series of advanced WordPress shortcodes that help you display dynamic content from your website's pages, posts, attachments, links and custom post types.

At a glance changes in version 2.0

* Eleven (11) new shortcodes
* Improvements to many shortcodes - new parameter options
* Delivery of some common jQuery plugins
* Changes to support other oik plugins
* New and updated APIs, actions and filters
* Fully documented using oik's dynamic API documentation

oik now provides 80 shortcodes including:

* [bw_pages], [bw_posts], [bw_thumbs], [bw_attachments], [bw_images], [bw_pdf] shortcodes to list subpages, posts, attachments or custom post types 
* [bw_list], [bw_tree] to display lists of links to pages, posts, attachments or custom post types 
* [bw_table] to tabulate pages, posts or custom post types
* [bw_bookmarks] to list links
* [paypal] shortcodes for PayPal buttons: Pay Now, Buy Now, Donate, Add to Cart, View Cart/Checkout
* [bw_block] & [bw_eblock], [div] & [ediv], [clear] - to create block structures within your pages, posts and even widgets
* [bw_button], [bw_contact_button] - to provide call-to-action button style links for Artisteer themes
* helper shortcodes for web designers and developers: [bw_editcss], [bwtrace], [bw_wpadmin], [bw_wtf], [stag] & [etag]

oik helps you to display information about you, your company, your social networking ids and your website using standard formats that search engines such as Google recognise.

* You enter your information once, then use oik shortcodes to display it wherever you want; in titles, post and page content, header, sidebar and footer widgets.
* Whenever you need to change a value you only need to update it in one place; and your website is updated instantly.
* Shortcodes to display often included key information include: [bw_contact], [bw_telephone], [bw_mobile], [bw_mailto], [bw_company], [bw_address], [bw_show_googlemap], [bw_directions], [bw_logo], [bw_qrcode], [bw_copyright]
* For your social networking use the [bw_follow_me] shortcode to display your links to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, etcetera

Features: 

* oik provides buttons to help you write the shortcodes, showing you the parameters you can choose and default values 
* oik provides a shortcode discovery page where you can find out about every shortcode which is active in your site
* lazy programming means that code is only loaded when it's actually needed
* smart means that the shortcodes can recognise the content in which they're used and adjust their behaviour accordingly
* oik is extendable - plugin developers can build on the oik base functionality 
* using the oik API: help, syntax information, examples AND HTML snippets can be produced for any plugin or theme that provides shortcodes
* oik is theme independent; meaning that you can change your theme without having to worry about whether or not the shortcodes will still work.
* oik uses microformats so that Google and other search engines can understand your content.

**"the oik plugin - for often included key-information"**

= Removal of child plugins (version 2.0) =

Up to and including version 1.17 the oik plugin included a number of optional modules which could be activated as and when you needed them.

In oik version 1.17, any activated module automatically relocated itself to become a separately maintainable plugin.
Each individual plugin is supported from an oik-plugins server. 
The version number of child plugins delivered with oik v1.17 was v1.18.

In version 2.0 the child plugins have been removed from the oik base package.

Plugins that were relocated and served from the oik-plugins servers were:

* [oik-bbpress](http://www.oik-plugins.com/oik-plugins/oik-bbpress-strip-tags-from-bbpress-forum-title-tooltips/) - to strip tags from bbPress forum title tooltips

* [oik-bwtrace](http://www.oik-plugins.com/oik-plugins/oik-bwtrace-debug-trace-for-wordpress/) - provides an advanced WordPress trace debug function, which logs trace information to a file, rather than including it within the web page output
